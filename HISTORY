CHANGES: US161 - TR11792 - Support
1) makeGenotype.py - update to handle gender collapsing correctly. 
    separated out writing of annotations (annotload input file) from writing 
    of genotypes (genotypeload input file). While creating genotype file, 
    load a dictionary key=order|mpID value=list of lines; parse the dictionary 
    after genotype file is created collapsing Male/Female dups to 'Both'.
