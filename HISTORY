CHANGES: US146 multi colony ids
case1 - update the load to parse the IMPC Colony ID Notes field so that it 
    can check for colonyID matches to multiple distinct colonyIDs for a strain.
case2 - Continue to report and skip colonyIDs for existing strains that are not 
    associated with the strain in MGI.
case3 - If the input file has multiple colonyIDs for a new strain that the 
    strain load constructs, the load should add one of these colonyIDs to the 
    IMPC Colony ID Notes field and report the other(s).  No genotypes or 
    annotations should be made
case4 -  The load should detect and report cases where two different strains 
    have the same colonyID, and the IMPC data should not be loaded (since it 
    is possible that curators may generate this case inadvertently).
