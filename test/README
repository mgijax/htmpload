for HDP-2 the following were removed from this product because,
according to Kim and Lori were used only to develop the scripts that remain
runtest_part1A.sh
runtest_part2.sh
makeOMIMTest.sh
makeGenotypeTest.sh
makeAnnotationTest.sh
mgi_omimload_test.txt
mgi_genotypeload_test.txt
mgi_annotload_test.txt

The following scripts/files have been updated to use any new config (rename)

makeAnnotationTest.sh
runtest_part3.sh
runtest_part3.py
mgi_sangermpload_test.txt
